RethinkDB Build Environment and Package Builder

This repo has tools to set up an environment for building RethinkDB,
and for using that environment to actually build RethinkDB.

Right now, you could run:

    ruby setup.rb

In general we will (at some point) want to support kicking off a mass
package build for a given rethinkdb git commit.  We also want to
support kicking off an individual package build for a particular
(rethinkdb git commit, platform) pair.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

 - rdbcheckout - clones rethinkdb and fetches the biggest external
   dependencies.  We have this here so we don't have to re-clone and
   fetch for every platform (a zillion times over).

 - bionic, buster, strech, centos8, et al - dockerfiles for building
   on specific platforms

In general we want to support different docker versions, and support
building for a specific RethinkDB checkout, and at some point we will
get to that.

The creator of this (Sam Hughes <sam@samuelhughes.com>) is a Docker
n00b, so feel free to second-guess his decisions.

SEARCH TERMS:

- "DISAPPEND": A TODO item for a build task that should be moved
  elsewhere.  But currently it isn't, to avoid re-fetching and
  re-building.

  In general, these Dockerfiles are developed in an append-only
  manner, because rebuilding images is really slow.  But if and when I
  have to touch the core file, I'll want to clean up that cruft.
