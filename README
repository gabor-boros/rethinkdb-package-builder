RethinkDB Mass Package Builder

   This repo has tools for building RethinkDB on a crapload of
   platforms.  It uses Docker because that's a way to get operating
   system images and run stuff on them.

   You will need Docker Edge (as of Nov. 21 2019) to use the buildx
   command.  More information is here:

       https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/

   Right now, you could run:

       docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use
       docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
       ruby setup.rb --arch amd64
       ruby setup.rb --arch arm64

   You might need to add some sudo's.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

   - rdbcheckout - clones rethinkdb and fetches the biggest external
     dependencies.  We have this here so we don't have to re-clone and
     fetch for every platform (a zillion times over).

     Keeps the checkout in /rdb

   - bionic, buster, strech, centos8, et al - dockerfiles for building
     on specific platforms

     Copies /rdb from rdbcheckout to /platform, then does its work.

NOTES:

   - The creator of this (Sam Hughes <sam@samuelhughes.com>) is a
     Docker n00b, so feel free to second-guess his decisions.

SEARCH TERMS:

   - "DISAPPEND": A TODO item for a build task that should be moved
     elsewhere.  But currently it isn't, to avoid re-fetching and
     re-building.

     In general, these Dockerfiles are developed in an append-only
     manner, because rebuilding images is really slow.  But if and
     when I have to touch the core file, I'll want to clean up that
     cruft.
